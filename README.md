**🗓️ Day 7** Prime Number Checker (C++)

This program checks whether a given number is **prime** or not.
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
## ✅ Approach
To determine if a number `n` is prime:
1. If `n < 2`, it is **not** prime.
2. Check divisibility from `2` to `sqrt(n)`:
   - If any number divides `n` completely, then `n` is **not prime**.
   - We only check till `sqrt(n)` because divisor pairs repeat after that.
3. If no divisor is found, the number is **prime**.
## 🧠 Why loop till √n?
Divisors of a number come in pairs  
`(a × b = n)`.  
After `√n`, these pairs start repeating.  
So checking up to square root is both correct and efficient.
## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- **O(√n)** — efficient for large values of `n`.
## 🧮 Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — constant space.

## 🗓️ Day 11 – Sum of Odd and Even Numbers


**Problem:** Given an integer `n`, return an array containing the sum of odd numbers and even numbers from 1 to `n`. 
The first element is the sum of odd numbers, and the second element is the sum of even numbers.
**Approach:**  
- Loop from 1 to `n`  
- Keep two variables to store the sum of odd and even numbers  
- Add numbers to the respective sum based on whether they are odd or even  
- Return a vector with `[oddSum, evenSum]`
**Time Complexity:** O(n)
