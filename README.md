**🗓️ Day 7** Prime Number Checker (C++)

This program checks whether a given number is **prime** or not.
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
## ✅ Approach
To determine if a number `n` is prime:
1. If `n < 2`, it is **not** prime.
2. Check divisibility from `2` to `sqrt(n)`:
   - If any number divides `n` completely, then `n` is **not prime**.
   - We only check till `sqrt(n)` because divisor pairs repeat after that.
3. If no divisor is found, the number is **prime**.
## 🧠 Why loop till √n?
Divisors of a number come in pairs  
`(a × b = n)`.  
After `√n`, these pairs start repeating.  
So checking up to square root is both correct and efficient.
## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- **O(√n)** — efficient for large values of `n`.
## 🧮 Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — constant space.
- Added the updated solution file in day7/solution.cpp.

#**🗓️ Day 8** GCD Using Euclid's Algorithm

This repository contains an efficient implementation of the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** using the **Euclidean Algorithm**.
## 📌 What is GCD?
The **Greatest Common Divisor** of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
Example:  
`gcd(24, 36) = 12`
---
## 🚀 Algorithm Used: Euclid's Algorithm
Euclid’s Algorithm is based on the principle:
Added the updated solution file in day8/solution.cpp.

**🗓️ Day 9**  Armstrong Number Checker

Today I solved the Armstrong Number problem.
✅ What I did
Counted the total digits in the number
Extracted each digit using % 10
Raised each digit to the power of the digit count
Calculated the sum of these powered digits
Compared it with the original number to check if it’s an Armstrong number
🎯 Key Learning

**🗓️ Day 10** – LCM of Two Numbers


Solved the “Least Common Multiple (LCM)” problem
Used the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) approach to compute LCM efficiently
Practiced the concept: LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b)
Implemented the logic using the Euclidean Algorithm
Added the solution file in day10/solution.cpp
Step by step, staying consistent with number-based problems! 💪🔥
- Moving ahead with more number-based problems tomorrow inshaAllah.🚀

## 🗓️ Day 11 – Sum of Odd and Even Numbers


**Problem:** Given an integer `n`, return an array containing the sum of odd numbers and even numbers from 1 to `n`. 
The first element is the sum of odd numbers, and the second element is the sum of even numbers.
**Approach:**  
- Loop from 1 to `n`  
- Keep two variables to store the sum of odd and even numbers  
- Add numbers to the respective sum based on whether they are odd or even  
- Return a vector with `[oddSum, evenSum]`
**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
**Example:**
Input: n = 5
Output: [9, 6] // odd sum = 1+3+5=9, even sum = 2+4=6.
- Moving ahead with more number-based problems tomorrow inshaAllah.
