Moving ahead with more number-based problems tomorrow inshaAllah!!


**🗓️ Day 6** – Count Factors of a Number

Solved the “Count Factors of a Number” problem.
Implemented both the basic method and an optimized approach using square root logic.
Learned how factor pairs work and why traversing only up to √n makes the solution faster.
Added the updated solution file in day6/solution.cpp.
Little progress every day adds up! 🚀
Moving ahead with more number-based problems tomorrow inshaAllah!!


**🗓️ Day 7** Prime Number Checker (C++)

This program checks whether a given number is **prime** or not.
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
## ✅ Approach
To determine if a number `n` is prime:
1. If `n < 2`, it is **not** prime.
2. Check divisibility from `2` to `sqrt(n)`:
   - If any number divides `n` completely, then `n` is **not prime**.
   - We only check till `sqrt(n)` because divisor pairs repeat after that.
3. If no divisor is found, the number is **prime**.
## 🧠 Why loop till √n?
Divisors of a number come in pairs  
`(a × b = n)`.  
After `√n`, these pairs start repeating.  
So checking up to square root is both correct and efficient.
## ⏱️ Time Complexity
- **O(√n)** — efficient for large values of `n`.
## 🧮 Space Complexity
- **O(1)** — constant space.
- Moving ahead with more number-based problems tomorrow inshaAllah!!!🚀
